# Specs Status

This document tracks the status of all specification documents in the project.

**UPDATED**: Specs have been revised to reflect the modular architecture design. Some functionality has been moved to separate tools in the Rustle ecosystem.

## Completed Specs

| Spec | Feature | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| 010 | Rustle Parse Tool | ✅ Complete |
| 030 | Complete INI Inventory Parsing | ✅ Complete |

## Updated Specs (Modular Architecture)

| Spec | Feature | Status | Notes |

## Modular Architecture Impact

**Tools in Scope for rustle-parse**:
- Core YAML/inventory parsing
- Basic variable resolution
- Syntax validation
- Vault content detection (markers)
- Basic template expressions
- Pipeline integration

**Tools Out of Scope** (handled by separate tools):
- Full vault decryption → `rustle-vault`
- Advanced template processing → `rustle-template`
- Execution planning → `rustle-plan`
- Task execution → `rustle-exec`
- System facts → `rustle-facts`

## Notes

- ✅ Complete: Spec has been fully implemented and tested
- 🔄 In Progress: Currently being implemented
- ⬜ Planned: Spec written but not yet implemented
- 📝 Updated: Spec revised for modular architecture
- Each spec number increments by 10 to allow for insertions
- Feature names should be concise (<40 chars) for table formatting
